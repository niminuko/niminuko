# About Me
I’m @niminuko, better known as Travis Howard. I have an interest in condensed matter physics and materials science, and representing problems in the aforementioned domains through methods of statistical learning and probability theory. As of 2021, I am a junior pursuing a B.Sc in Applied Physics at Texas Tech University.
# Where I'm At Now
I’m currently learning conventional quantum theory and mathematical statistics, and have **several years** of experience in programming (primarily Python, Bash, and Java) in addition to solving common problems in the physical sciences. I’m open to collaborate on any project at least tangentially related to physics and/or chemistry, and which utilizes either machine learning or computational data analysis in some fashion.
# Why Condensed Matter?
Ultimately, I'm looking to help further develop the field of **materials informatics** in order to facilitate the discovery and creation of sustainable materials and quantum materials. Every piece of technology, every *thing* that we use is developed of some material, engineered from resources our planet produces. We must pay attention to the scarcity of such resources and how the materials we use affect our planet, while also economically competing with state-of-the-art products.

Condensed matter physics arguably serves as the backbone and theoretical framework from which materials scientists build upon and use. Such a theoretical framework may help bolster the interpretability of statistical learning models, assuming such models are inspired by well-posed questions pertaining to condensed matter physics. In contrast, insight gained from said statistical learning models may help further strengthen the theoretical framework: a model is used to investigate an event, and the interpretation(s) of that model may then be used to help advance the field.
